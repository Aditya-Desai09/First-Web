            <h2 style="color: white;">ROLES:</h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
              <li>There are a total of four Valorant roles in the game.</li>
              <li>The Valorant roles are Duelist, Initiator, Sentinel, and Controller.</li>
              <li>Each role has responsibilities that are integral to winning the game.</li>
              <li>Your abilities are geared towards helping you fulfill your role but won't limit you in-game.</li>
              </ul>
            </p><br>
            <p>DUALISTS :
              <ul><li>Duelists act as the entry fraggers of each team. They generally play aggressively and look for early picks and opportunities to kill. Most of a Duelist's abilities are geared toward getting kills and dealing damage.</li></ul>
            </p><br>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>CONTROLLER :
        <ul><li>The Controllers are up next, and I don't mean the ones with joysticks. Controllers or more commonly known as “smokers,” are the ones primarily responsible for blocking vision and creating space by zoning enemies out.</li></ul>
      </p><br>
      <p>Initiators :
        <ul><li>Initiators are a literal definition of setting your team up for success. They are great at gathering information and using their skills to assist their allies. They make their team's life easier by helping them get kills or helping them make decisions.</li></ul>
      </p><br>
      <p>Sentinels :
        <ul><li>The final role is the Sentinel. Sentinels are known as being insane defensive strongholds. They are the main star on the defending side and can hold an enemy team down and prevent them from gaining space.</li></ul>
      </p><br>
      <h2 style="color: white;">AGENTS:</h2>
      <p>
      <ul><li>Picking your Agent to main, or even which Agent to unlock, can be challenging for new players, so we're going to break things down to make your decision easier. VALORANT currently has 23 Agents, as of DECEMBER 2023. Each agent comes with four unique abilities that you can use to mislead, outflank, and decimate your enemies.</li></ul>

Instead, he respawns instantly at the location where Run it Back was initiated. This effect persists for 10 seconds unless Phoenix is eliminated, after which he reverts to the origin point.

              Gekko uses his abilities (the four creatures) to blind, confuse, and disable the enemy. While his abilities can be considered weaker than other Agents' abilities that do the same thing, Gekko's abilities are rechargeable if he picks them up after use, with the exception of Mosh Pit.
